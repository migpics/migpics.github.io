# Being Mig
Hola Mundo!  
My name is Miguel Valenzuela and I am an engineer, photographer, artist and inventor of PancakeBot.
I set this GitHub page up to make it easy to post my small projects for other to see.  I wish I could say I was a professional programmer but I am more of a professional 'Jack-of-all-trades and master-of-nothing' kind of thing.
But I want to become more profficient at learning Javascript and so I am working on creating small programs for PancakeBot to generate pancakes outside of the normal Pancake Painter Program.
One that I have created recently is called Spiral Pancake Generator and was created with the help of Chris Means and Kris Pagels.  
Check it out here at [a link](http://migpics.github.io/spg)
Next, on to new adventures!
Miguel
